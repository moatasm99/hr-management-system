# Sidebar Design Update

I have updated the sidebar design to match the image you provided. The changes include:

1.  **Header Redesign:**
    *   Added the purple icon/logo with the "HR Portal" title and "Dashboard" subtitle.
    *   Used the indigo color scheme as shown in the design.

2.  **Navigation Items:**
    *   **Active State:** Items now highlight with a solid indigo background, white text, and a subtle shadow, exactly like the "Dashboard" item in your image.
    *   **Inactive State:** Items are clean gray with a hover effect.
    *   **Icons:** Updated icons to better match the visual style (Calendar for Dashboard, Clipboard for Requests, Dollar for Payroll, Sparkles for Experience).

3.  **Layout Improvements:**
    *   Increased spacing for a more modern, airy feel.
    *   Added rounded corners (`rounded-xl`) to menu items.
    *   Updated the user profile section in the top bar to match the improved aesthetic.

The new sidebar is fully responsive and supports dark mode as well! 🎨
